# Rating-Product-Sorting-Reviews-in-Amazon

## BUSINESS PROBLEM
One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after sales. The solution to this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, prominence of the product for the sellers and a smooth shopping experience for the buyers. Another problem is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. Since misleading comments will directly affect the sale of the product, it will cause both financial loss and loss of customers. This project demonstrates the solution to these two basic problems.
